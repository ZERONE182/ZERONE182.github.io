  abstract={Cryo-electronmicroscopy(cryo-EM)has revolutionized structural biology by resolving 3D structures of biomolecules at near-atomic resolution. However, revealing the continuous conformational heterogeneity from hundreds of thousands of noisy particle images remains challenging. Recent advances in heterogeneous reconstruction, often conducted in the Fourier domain, suffer from a lack of interpretability and are limited in achieving higher resolution in locally flexible regions. To address this issue, we propose CryoFormer, a novel approach for high-resolution and continuous heterogeneous cryo-EM reconstruction. CryoFormer leverages a feature volume in the real domain to capture fine-grained local changes. We then design a novel query-based transformer architecture that incorporates deformation-aware features and region-wise spatial features using a cross-attention mechanism. Our transformer-based pipeline further supports pose refinement and can automatically highlight flexible regions by visualizing 3D attention maps. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves the best performance on five datasets (two synthetic and three experimental). We also contribute a new synthetic dataset of the PEDV spike protein for more comprehensive evaluations. Both the code and the PEDV dataset will be released for better reproducibility.},
